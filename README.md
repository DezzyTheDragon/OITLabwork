# OITLabwork
A repository for some of my lab work while I was at The Oregon Institute of Technology.

After 4 years of hard work this is a small collection of the work I have done to demonstrate some of the things I have done and show my ability to use C and C++ and my comfort programming in linux

cst320_Compilers
This folder contains the work I did for my compiler class. Using C we wrote a basic compiler for the language pascalish, a simplified reduced version of pascal. The tests folders contain tests written to check to make sure that the compiler works.
